         We did this with the help of delegate method in "MainNationalParksViewController.swift". So no need to do this here. But you should know that you can handle cell positioning, size, spacing, and lot of other things using properties from super class directly and then set them here. OR other way is to use UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout protocol and then return properties values from those methods OR third way is to get access to the object of this "FlowLayout" class in MainNationalParksViewController and then set properties of items there, which we did in "viewDidLoad" method.
         
         So you should be aware about all these 3 ways of accessing properties of items. Layout object(it could be flow layout or custom layout) associated with collection view is responsible for all this. Collection View does not directly deal with the positioning, size....etc of cells/items.
